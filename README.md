# Santander Customer Satisfaction Prediction
Binary Classification｜Feature Engineering｜Imbalanced Data｜Production-Level Tabular ML

This project is based on the classic Kaggle competition **Santander Customer Transaction Prediction**. The goal is to predict whether a user will perform a specific transaction behavior using a highly anonymized dataset of numerical features.  

The project primarily demonstrates my capabilities in:

- Processing large-scale tabular data  
- Feature engineering and feature selection  
- KFold model validation  
- LightGBM/XGBoost model design  
- SHAP-based model interpretability analysis
