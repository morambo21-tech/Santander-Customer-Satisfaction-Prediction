# Santander Customer Satisfaction Prediction
Industrial-Scale Tabular Data · Binary Classification · Explainable ML

This project is based on the classic Kaggle competition **Santander Customer Transaction Prediction**, with the goal of predicting whether a user will perform a specific action (such as a transaction, review, or other binary classification event).  
The project primarily showcases my capabilities in:  

- Processing highly anonymized data  
- Large-scale feature engineering  
- Model hyperparameter tuning (LightGBM)  
- Building a complete ML pipeline
